Each member of the team will contribute to all aspects of the project,
however, a lax team role proposal will be presented below:

Backend developers:
Radu, Sergiu, Vlad

Frontend developers:
Melisa, Laura, Serghei

In reality the team will be more flexible, everyone contributing where is needed. Moreover, each person will
have specific tasks to perform, tasks not necessarily in tune with the separation outlined above.
