I propose the project be separated into 3 different apps:
* LoginApp - managing the user login
* StudentApp - managing the students view of the application
* TeacherApp - managing the teachers view of the app

The main entities the model should contain in the beginning:
Student, Teacher, Staff, Course - defined in LoginApp
Grade - defined in TeacherApp

In time, as more features are to be developed, more models will be needed.
